            one with grace and determination. She is the heart and soul of our family—our strength,

            dedication.Though she has never received any formal awards, she has won the world for us with her
            sacrifices, her support, and her endless care. She has shaped our lives quietly but powerfully,
            managing everything with steady hands and a tender heart.Thank you, Maa, for being our pride, our
            blessing, and the light that leads us forward. Your love is the foundation of our home, and your 
            spirit will always be our greatest strength.

            Karnam Malleswari is a true trailblazer in Indian sports history—the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal.
            Born on June 1, 1975, inVoosavanipeta, Andhra Pradesh, she began weightlifting at the age of 12 and quickly
            rose through the ranks with sheer determination and grit.Her crowning moment came at the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
            where she lifted a total of 240 kg (110 kg in snatch and 130 kg in clean and jerk) to win bronze in the 69 kg 
            category. That single medal was India's only one at those Games, and it made her a national icon.
            Beyond the Olympics, her career is studded with achievements: World Champion in 1994 and 1995 in the 54 kg category.
            29 international medals,including 11 golds. Arjuna Award (1994), Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna (1999), and Padma Shri (1999).
            After retiring, she continued to inspire by taking on leadership roles, including being appointed Vice-Chancellor
            of Delhi Sports University in 2021. She also founded the Karnam Malleswari Foundation to promote weightlifting and 
            empower young athletes.

            Madurai Shanmukhavadivu Subbulakshmi, born on September 16, 1916, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, was a legendary Carnatic
             vocalist and one of India’s most revered musicians. Raised in a musically rich environment—her mother was a veena 
             player—Subbulakshmi began performing at a young age and gave her first public concert at just 11.She trained under 
             Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer in Carnatic music and Pandit Narayanrao Vyas in Hindustani music, mastering both traditions.
             Her voice, known for its purity and emotional depth, captivated audiences across India 
             and the world.
             Her accolades are staggering:
             - Bharat Ratna (1998) – India’s highest civilian honor.
             - Ramon Magsaysay Award (1974) – often called Asia’s Nobel Prize.
             - Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, and Sangeetha Kalanidhi, among many others.
            Subbulakshmi was not just a musician—she was a cultural ambassador, a philanthropist, and a symbol of humility. 
            She passed away on December 11, 2004, but her voice continues to echo in temples, homes, and hearts.
